 It’s different from all walks of life, in it hard work is not seen and doesn’t pay off  
hours of hard labour, sleepless nights but in all, nothing pays back off, because everything that they do is useless, because
they don’t live in mansions, they don’t eat good foods, they don’t own anything on media, no one believes they can do anything, they don’t own cars, their houses are just enough for their own families
